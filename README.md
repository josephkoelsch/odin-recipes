My name is Joe Koelsch. I'm about halfway through the Foundations course
in the Odin Project. This is the first project that I'm going taking from
beginning to end. So far, I only have experience with html, so this page
will likely be pretty basic. Stay tuned for a reflections section at the end
sharing my experience.
