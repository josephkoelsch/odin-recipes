odin-recipes project for Foundations Course

Description

My name is Joe Koelsch. I'm about halfway through the Foundations course
in the Odin Project. This is the first project that I'm going taking from
beginning to end. The assignment was to create a website linking to several
recipes. The goal was to practice building a site using simple HTML tools.
Thus far, I have only worked in HTML, and so the project
is super basic. I believe that the project will grow over time.
Stay tuned for a reflections section at the end
sharing my experience.
