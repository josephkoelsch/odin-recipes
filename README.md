odin-recipes project for Foundations Course

Description

My name is Joe Koelsch. I'm about halfway through the Foundations course
in the Odin Project. This is the first project that I'm going taking from
beginning to end. The assignment was to create a website linking to several
recipes. The goal was to practice building a site using simple HTML tools.
Thus far, I have only worked in HTML, and so the project
is super basic. I believe that the project will grow over time.
Stay tuned for a reflections section at the end
sharing my experience.

Reflection

I've learned a ton through building and styling this project. 
The initial build went rather smoothly, 
as I was only using elements that were explicitly taught in the curriculum. 
I met all of the base-line criteria with very few hiccups. 
But the more I built, the more ideas I had to make the page better.
I knew that I could do things like change the border of my images,
change the way that links looked, add more links to connect pages, 
but those skills were not taught in the curriculum. These were the moments
when I learned the most. I had to research methods, test them out, and 
problem-solve based on my very basic understandings. There's nothing
like that feeling you get when, after a dozen iterations, you finally
hit on the code that makes the page do what you want it to do.
It's a fun feeling.
Moving forward, I feel like I'm still pretty shaky with github. 
The webpage when viewed on my device looks better than it does
viewed through the web. I'm assuming it has something to do with 
how I'm linking my page to github, but, as with everything else,
I'm just going to have to figure it out.
