    <H1>About Me</H1>

    <img src="https://illustrativemathematics.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Koelsch-Head-Shot.jpg" width="400px">

    <p>My name is Joe Koelsch, and I'm a 7th grade math teacher in Memphis, TN.
        I've been teaching math for 13 years, and every year I tell my kids
        the story of my mathematical education. I've always loved math.
        So much so that, when people asked me what I wanted to be when I 
        grew up, I'd always say, "a mathematician" or "an engineer."
        Unfortunately, I had a string of bad math teachers in high school
        that drove me away from studying anything analytical in college.
        I studied literature in college, and have had a very successful
        and happy work-life, but there's still a part of me that wonders
        what I could've been had I stuck with math and engineering.
        It is this wondering that drove me to learn to code and
        more specifically to <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">
            The Odin Project</a>.

   <H1>About This Project</H1>
    <p align="left"> This is the first project that I'm going taking from
        beginning to end. The assignment was to create a website linking to several
        recipes. The goal was to practice building a site using simple HTML tools, and then styling using CSS.
        Thus far, I have only worked in HTML and CSS, and so the project
        is pretty basic. I hope that the project will grow over time.
        To see how I'm feeling, check out the reflections section below.</p>
        <p>That said, I stand by these recipes. 
            If you want some <a href=recipes/pancakes.html>yummy pancakes</a>, 
            some <a href=recipes/lasagna.html>delicious lasagna</a>,
            or something for <a href=recipes/tacos.html>Taco Tuesday</a>
            you could absolutely do worse than these.</p>
    
    <H1>Reflection</H1>
    <p align="left">I've learned a ton through building and styling this project. 
        The initial build went rather smoothly, 
        as I was only using elements that were explicitly taught in the curriculum. 
        I met all of the base-line criteria with very few hiccups. 
        But the more I built, the more ideas I had to make the page better.
        I knew that I could do things like change the border of my images,
        change the way that links looked, add more links to connect pages, 
        but those skills were not taught in the curriculum. These were the moments
        when I learned the most. I had to research methods, test them out, and 
        problem-solve based on my very basic understandings. There's nothing
        like that feeling you get when, after a dozen iterations, you finally
        hit on the code that makes the page do what you want it to do.
        It's a fun feeling.
        Moving forward, I feel like I'm still pretty shaky with github. 
        The webpage when viewed on my device looks better than it does
        viewed through the web. I'm assuming it has something to do with 
        how I'm linking my page to github, but, as with everything else,
        I'm just going to have to figure it out. <a href=index.html>Home.</a>
